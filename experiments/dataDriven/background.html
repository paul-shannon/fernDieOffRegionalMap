   Extensive lab and field work and consultations with fern experts
   throughout the US lead us to conclude with considerable confidence:

   <ul>
    <li> The die-off is caused by an unidentified and possibly novel pathogen.

    <li> Climate change and local drought may be contributing factors, but until the
    proximal cause of the die-off is determined, the role of climate
    can not be known.

    <li> The die-off is unprecedented. We have no evidence that it is
       part of the P.munitum life cycle, in which ferns colonize open
       ground and rarely reproduce under a closed canopy, with individual
       plants typically living for hundreds of years.  We tentatively
       claim that to a first approximation, and pending rigorous
       study of the population structures of healthy sword ferns in
       healthy forests, that sword ferns die of "natural causes" very
       infrequently.

    <li> The die-off has implications for the forest at Seward Park, and for
       other forests in the region.
